Final Project for Graduate Course MEEG667-010: Digital Control

The objective of this project was to build and program a line-following robot to track the black line trajectory. We built our robot using the two-wheeled turtle bot chassis fitted with three line tracking sensors to detect the black line trajectory. We selected the RomeoV2 as our choice of microcontroller. The rest of this report provides further details about the individual components of our robot and the final configuration of the assembly. In addition to that, we also describe the control logic that we used to program the microcontroller, using Arduino, such that the robot reaches the destination by following the black line trajectory. Finally, we present the results regarding the robotâ€™s
performance.
